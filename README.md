- a project where i've tested RESTful API using Postman
- the logic flow (CRUD):
  *-- User:*
  1. register user
  2. login user
  3. update profile
  *-- Goals:*
  1. create goal
  2. get goals
  3. get single goal / path variable
  4. update goals
  5. delete goals
  6. show progress
- i've used production and collection variables, authorization bearer token, path variables, etc
- to generate the tests report i've used newman-reporter-htmlextra, where you can find it by clicking on the link below:
