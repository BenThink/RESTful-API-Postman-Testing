- a project where i've used CRUD to test RESTful API using Postman
- the logic flow:
  
  *User:*
  - register user
  - login user
  - update profile
     
  *Goals:*
  - create goal
  - get goals
  - get single goal / path variable
  - update goals
  - delete goals
  - show progress
- i've used production and collection variables, authorization bearer token, path variables, etc
- i've created multiple tests for:
  - different Status Codes, Response Body, Response Headers, etc
- you can download the file 'GOAL TRACKER - API.postman_collection.json' and import it into your Postman to see all the work:
  - CRUD
  - Requests
  - Prerequest Scripts
  - Test Scripts
  - Assertions
  - etc.
- if you want to see only the tests results you can download the file 'GOAL TRACKER - API.postman_test_run.json' and import it into your Postman 
- or you can just click on the link below where i've used 'newman-reporter-htmlextra' to generate the tests report:
